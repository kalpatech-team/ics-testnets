## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-12-11: Spawn time: `2022-12-11T17:00:00.000000Z`
  * 2022-12-11: Proposal 88 voting period ends
  * 2022-12-08: Proposal 88 goes into voting period
  * 2022-12-08: Genesis file without CCV state is generated

Kalpa will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/blob/main/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md#consumer-chain-start-process) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `kalpad` binary built using the `kalpatech-team/kalpa` repo tag [v0.1.0](https://github.com/kalpatech-team/kalpa/releases/tag/v0.1.0). You can generate the binary following the [Get Started section](https://github.com/kalpatech-team/kalpa/tree/v0.1.0#get-started).

### Verify Binary Checksum.
Binary checksums can differ based on many things to include go, libc, and make versions. To get a consistent checksum you can use something like docker to verify.

  * [Linux amd64 build](kalpad)
  * Version: `v0.1.0`
  * SHA256: `5dc4f891398f811b9ea49abc14a083ec87072b50ed92b72079760f81369fd625`

  Example of using a volume mount to get the binary outside of the container onto your ubuntu server.
  ```
  #run on your ubuntu server
  # use the `realpath` for the volume mount.
  docker run -v /home/kalpa/blockchain:/blockchain -it --entrypoint /bin/bash ghcr.io/strangelove-ventures/checksum:v.0.1.0
  ```
  ```
  # run inside docker container.
  git clone https://github.com/kalpatech-team/kalpa.git
  cd kalpa
  git fetch
  git checkout v0.1.0
  make install
  sha256sum ~/go/bin/kalpad
  ```
  expected return `5dc4f891398f811b9ea49abc14a083ec87072b50ed92b72079760f81369fd625`  


### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **`pending spawn time`**
- SHA256: `pending spawn time`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `kalpa`
* Denom: `ukalpa`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* IBC timeout: `"86400"`
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`kalpa-fresh-genesis.json`](kalpa-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `108ccbbd873be810412ba11eab013b8462ba618569ec491403521d396d07e3b4`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p persistent peers : `coming-soon`**
* These peers represent the `KalpaTech` validator. Please consider sharing your peers in discord, or create a PR to [`peers.txt`](peers.txt)

* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `8640`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - kalpa service: [kalpa-init.sh](kalpa-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [kalpa-init-cv.sh](kalpa-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.kalpa/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - kalpa
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable kalpa
    sudo systemctl start kalpa
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-kalpa
    sudo systemctl start cv-kalpa
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - kalpa: `journalctl -fu kalpa`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-kalpa`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
